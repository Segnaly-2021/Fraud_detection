In this project, I worked on a highly skewed credit card fraud detection dataset.

I explored four ML algorithms:
- LogisticRegression,
- RandomForestClassifier,
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier,
- LinearSVC

For each model, I trained it in three different scenarios:
- trained directly on the imbalanced dataset
- trained on a re-balanced dataset by downsampling the majority class
- trained with a weighted loss function on the entire dataset.

You can open the notebook for more details!!!
